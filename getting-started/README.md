# Getting Started with Cisco Packet Tracer - Notes

This course outlines the basic usage of CPT. CPT is primarily interacted with through
one of two modes: logical mode or physical mode.

Logical mode gives an architecture overview of the relationships between devices on a
network, less so to the verbosity of physical mode; which defines the physical linkages
and placement of devices in their respective locations.

Module 1 introduced the software and it's basic usage (i.e. keyboard shorts, where things are, etc.)
and concluded with a Packet Tracer Tutored Activity (PTTA) titled "Logical and Physical Mode Exploration"
that had me install a back-up router in a network closet and configure it's hostname.

As this software is produced by Cisco, I believe all devices with CLI-capabilities are running an emulated
version of Cisco's Internetworking Operating System (IOS), which has a rather unfortunate acronym.

I've been suprised by the fidelity of specifically physical mode. Being able to interact with all parts of
the devices, from power to the individual ports which I can further connect together with a variety of cabling,
is really impressive in my opinion.
