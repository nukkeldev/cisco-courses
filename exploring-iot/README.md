# Exploring Internet of Things with Cisco Packet Tracer - Notes

## Module 1

### Section 2

- Many IoT devices in CPT can be interacted with `alt+click`
- `MTBF` - Mean time between failure

#### Activity 1.1.3

It was pretty cool to see how many IoT devices that are modeled in CPT. The activity
had us add new devices to the IoT network via a home gateway which then reflected
on the gateway's interface.

### Section 3

The home gateway serves as a local connection point for IoT devices, with auto-discovery
on by default. It can provide wireless connectivity, internet access, and local logic to
connected devices.

#### Activity 1.2.3

This activity had us set up an IoT network given a cable modem. We connected a home
gateway and various IoT devices to the gateway wired and wirelessly and saw them
appear on the IoT Monitor application.

Along with a home gateway, a dedicated registration server can be setup that devices
can be configured to connect to. This allows for the devices to be controlled from
both inside and outside of the network depending on where the registration server is
accessible from.

#### Activity 1.2.6

In this activity, we configured a few devices to use a registration server instead of
a home gateway. It asked for us to set the configure the server's address on the devices
to be `home.com` but that didn't work so I had to use the IP address instead which marked
me down on grading lol. Overall pretty cool.

## Module 2

### Section 1

This section deals with environment containers.

#### Activity 2.0.5

We adjusted the ambient temperature throughout the day,

### Section 2

THINGS

#### Activity 2.1.3

We made a Security Camera thing and saved it to the custom thing dialog.

#### Activity 2.1.6

Using the Motion Detector's script, modified the security camera to act the same way.

## Conclusion

This was a fun course, not as in-depth as I would have liked but fun nonetheless.
