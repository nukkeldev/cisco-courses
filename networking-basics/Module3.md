# Module 3: Wireless and Mobile Networks

## Section 1: Wireless Networks

Cellphones use a variety of wireless networks to facilitate their communication. Below are some
common ones:
- The Cellular Provider's Network - Enables voice calls, internet access (data), etc.
- Bluetooth - Low-power, short range P2P connections.
- WiFi - Short range connections through a centralized router; uses radio waves.
- NFC - Near-field Communication; extremely short range; uses EM fields.
- GPS - Location triangulation with satellites (+-10m).

Modern cellphones are capable of using all the above mentioned networks simultaneously.

## Section 2: Mobile Device Connectivity

When a Bluetooth device is discover-able, sometimes called pairing mode, it transmits the
following information upon request:
- Name
- Bluetooth class
- Services that the recipient device can use
- Technical information, such as features or the supported Bluetooth specification

Additionally, the device being requested for pairing might ask for a PIN to connect.
