# Module 6: Network Media

Networking media is most commonly of 3 types:

1. Copper - Ethernet, Coaxial, etc.
   - Electrical impulses.
2. Fiber-optic
   - Pulses of light 
3. Wireless - WiFi, etc.
   - EM wave frequency modulation

Each type has different properties that define when best to use it. For instance, copper and
wireless media have far less range than fiber optic but are both significantly cheaper.

The four main criteria for choosing media are:
- What is the max distance?
- What installation environment?
- How much data and bandwidth?
- Cost?

## Cabling

- Twisted-Pair Cable (`UTP`)
  - An ethernet cable that is comprised of four pairs one solid and one striped.
- Coaxial cable
  - Solid copper core with plastic insulation and metal shielding.
- Fiber-optic
  - Extremely thin glass or plastic core, no need for EM shielding.
  - Very high bandwidth.
