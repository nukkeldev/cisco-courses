# Checkpoint Exam 1: Build a Small Network

I got a 95% (19/20) on the first attempt due to Q19 asking about MAC filtering which was never
covered in the previous modules. Additionally, Q16 asked about the specific frequency band that
802.11b/g uses, that being 2.4GHz, which was also never covered.

I retook it for 100%.
